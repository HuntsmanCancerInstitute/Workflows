This workflow utilizes a public docker image to execute a snakemake somatic variant workflow.  Specifically, three tumor normal somatic short variant analyis applications (GATK-Mutect2, Illumina-Manta/Strelk2, and Lofreq) are launched, lightly filtered, and combine into a composite vcf file.  The vcf record's ID column lists the callers that reported each variant.  To create a universal variant QUAL score independent of a particular callers algorithm, each variant's allele frequency is converted into a z-score by comparing it to the  non-reference allele frequencies in a panel of normals at that position.  This bkz score also effectively down weights variants in error prone regions of the genome controling for localized platform specific artifacts.

See the somTriCaller_xxx.slurm.sh for detailed usage instructions.
