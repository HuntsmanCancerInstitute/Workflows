# Workflows

Snakemake workflows for best practice genomic analysis developed by the [Bioinformatics 
Shared Resource](https://healthcare.utah.edu/huntsmancancerinstitute/research/shared-resources/center-managed/bioinformatics/) 
at the [Huntsman Cancer Institute](http://www.huntsmancancer.org/). Most are developed 
for execution at [CHPC](https://www.chpc.utah.edu) on our owner nodes, either directly 
by `slurm` submission or through the HCI pysano job queue system.

Navigate to individual folders to see what's available.
